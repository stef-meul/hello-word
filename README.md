# hello-word
tutorial
hey, i'm reading about this project and learning how to work with this platform. At this instance I'm going through the hello world activities, which I named hello word, because semantics have something to do with how meaning is given through learning.


here i'd like to show you a video of a piece i made a few years ago:

and this is about another work that i've done after that:
